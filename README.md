# COMP3005FinalProject
-- QT Creator --

Blair Hawke - 100993006

Solo group project

README

The following application is made with QT Creator in C++.

The instructions for running the code are to open QT Creator and open the 'COMP3005-finalProject.pro' file.

From here you can click build and the bookstore app will appear.

All buttons are set up but I was unable to set up the database.

In the end I wish I had more time to implement functionality but I was under heavy time constaints for this project.
